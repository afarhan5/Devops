# Assignment-03 :-

Suppose your client has infrastructure running over the AWS cloud, but for the past few days, the client application has not been able to handle enough traffic and load, so he is thinking of setting up any reverse proxy for handling the load as middleware. He called you from the DevOps team and explained the problem statement. You have explained very well about the plan and design that you are going to perform."""  

You were told that nginx needs to be set up in between your client and application service, which can handle the request, but we need to setup one more thing, which is the basic HA (high availability) and DR (disaster recovery) of that middleware setup. Tasks would be done day-wise. 

 Day 1:  

- Create instance and install nginx on that, after that create an AMI-1 

- Create instance from the above AMI-1 and make V1 

- Do some changes in same instance and  again create AMI-2  

- Create instance from the above AMI-2 and make V2 

- Make both V1 and V2 AMI's  

- Now you have 2 AMI's total  

 

You have to continue the strategy with autoscaling group, attach asg on LB and follow the same strategy and make this highly available by testing load test on the nginx server so that it would autoscale at the time of load. 

  Attach the policy to asg and increase the stress according to policy mentioned then analyse the result. ( Try every policy ) 

    - Avg CPU utilization 

    - Network bytes in/out 

    - ALB requests count per target. 

Somehow client needs version upgrade in Nginx so please upgrade V1 to V2 that you have made 

 

"""But the client has complained to us that our new version V2 is not compatible with the service, so please revert back. You need to revert back to the previous version. """ 

Day 2: """Client has told you about the change in it's Nginx as he needs this tool as hosting webpage too, so you need to plan accordingly. Also, he has specially mentioned that all tasks should be performed from their AWS environment, which means all O/P would be done through EC2 only. """ 

- You need to pull image content which would be display at the time of webpage hosting from VCS git and push your images on S3 bucket using aws-cli. (Do not use secrete and access keys) 
- You need to create a frontend including images in nginx page which will be fetched directly from S3 bucket. 

Day3: 

"""Now client has again told us to test it continuously to see if ASG is working or not if my server got unhealthy."""  

Enter in the server and make some changes in server in order to make server unhealthy. Now analyze the result to see how ASG can help you to maintain your instance desire state. 

 
========================================== 

(Remember the special points from client) 

NOTE 1: You need to create the utility in such a way that it will make AMI of specific version and attach to the asg and perform the rolling deployment strategie. In case of revert back you should also have the function of revert back feature.  

NOTE 2: But always remember first do it all the tasks manually.
